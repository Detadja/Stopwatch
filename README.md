# Stopwatch
* This is a school project created in Vivado to be uploaded and run on a Zynq Blackboard. It is a stopwatch built for four 7-segment displays, controlled by 4 buttons: One button starts the timer, one stops it at the current time, one increments the time by one millisecond, and the last button resets the timer.
